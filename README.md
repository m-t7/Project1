# Project 1 - ChadaTech Clock

## Description
This project was created help ChadaTech meet international standard ISO 8601 by allowing users with an interface to view and modify both a 12 and 24 hour clock.

## Reflection 
### What did you do particularly well?
I ensured the requirements of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for this project were met and working successfully before extending or modifying any additional code. This aided me greatly when developing this project.

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
If I were to this project over, I would avoid putting any logic in the "main()" function and instead obscured it behind a separate header file. 
I could also add logic to account for invalid user inputs and handle expected or acceptable errors using a try / catch.


### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part of this project was getting the clocks to appear side-by-side in the console. Stack Overflow and CppReference.com helped me overcome this challenge by providing unique examples of console output formatting and are definitely resources I will be adding to my support network. 

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
1 easily transferrable skill that I've used on this project is the ability to take a task, break it down, and truly understand the underlying requirements in order to complete it.

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Whenever programming, I tend to add comments and ensure variables are aptly named regarding their functionality to ensure clarity. This helps increase readability and maintainability as it's infinitely easier to follow the structure of the code and what the application is designed to do. Header files, such as the Clock.H file in this project, are also ways to increase adaptability and maintainability as it allows us to obfuscate, modify, or extend methods to other source files without changing the code in those files.
